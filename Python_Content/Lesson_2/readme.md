# Simple Math Operations in Python ➕➖✖️➗

This is my second Python lesson, focusing on basic math operators and how to assign values to variables.

## 📋 Description

This script demonstrates how to:

- Assign values to variables
- Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Use `print()` to display the results
- Round decimal values using `round()`


## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Variables – Storing data for later use
- Arithmetic Operators – +, -, *, /
- Data Types – Integers and floats
- Rounding – Using round() to control decimal places
- Comments – Making code more readable


## 🚀 How to Run
- Save the code in a file named math_operations.py
- Open a terminal or command prompt
- Run the file using: python math_operations.py


## 🧭 Next Steps
Continue practicing with different values and operators. Try experimenting with:
-- Modulo (%) operator
-- User input with input()
-- More complex expressions


## 🧾 Code Overview

```python
# Assigning variables
number1 = 20
number2 = 6

# Performing math operations
sum_result = number1 + number2       # Addition
difference = number1 - number2       # Subtraction
product = number1 * number2          # Multiplication
quotient = round(float(number1 / number2), 3)  # Division

# Displaying the results
print(sum_result)
print("Subtraction:", difference)
print("Multiplication:", product)
print("Division:", quotient)

# Sample Output
26
Subtraction: 14
Multiplication: 120
Division: 3.333
